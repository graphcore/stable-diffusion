[Insert short description of model]

Graphcore's IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit) is a completely new kind of massively parallel processor to accelerate machine intelligence. Developers can access advanced, cost-efficient IPU compute on-demand in the cloud for building, fine-tuning and deploying AI models such as [Model name].


## [Model name] notebooks powered by IPUs

| Notebook | Framework | Type | Try for Free 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Notebook title] | Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow | Training, Fine-tuning, Inference | [![Gradient](https://assets.paperspace.io/img/gradient-badge.svg)](https://ipu.dev/RxNoMC)

[Description of notebook, for example] 
In this Paperspace Gradient notebook, we demonstrate using Whisper Tiny for speech recognition and transcription on the IPU. We use Optimum Graphcore - a new open-source library and toolkit that enables developers to access IPU-optimized models certified by Hugging Face. Only a few lines of code are needed to get this state-of-the-art automated speech recognition model running on IPUs. 

[Repeat the above layout if there is more than one notebook]

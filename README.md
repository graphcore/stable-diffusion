# Stable Diffusion on IPUs

![Images generated by Stable Diffusion model](stable-diffusion-header.jpg)

Stable Diffusion is one of the standout stars of the generative AI revolution. This alternative to Dall-E and Midjourney, is an open-source text-to-image model that has received widespread acclaim in the generative art scene for the quality and versatility of its images.

Run Stable Diffusion for yourself with Paperspace notebooks on Graphcore's IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit), a completely new kind of massively parallel processor designed to accelerate machine intelligence. Access advanced, cost-efficient IPU compute on demand in the cloud on Paperspace to build, fine-tune and deploy AI models such as Stable Diffusion.

These notebooks demonstrate how you can run inference on Stable Diffusion models on Graphcore IPUs for the following tasks::
* text-to-image generation (Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion v2)
* image-to-image generation
* text guided in-painting
